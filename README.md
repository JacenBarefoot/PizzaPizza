# PizzaPizza
### An online ordering system.
This project was created by Jacen Barefoot and Rylee Chisholm. The languages we used were JavaScript and HTML/CSS. We decided to go with a pizza ordering system idea since we both work at a pizza place. The user can click on an item they want to get and it gets added to the ticket. They can add more items or remove them, either one changes the total at the bottom of the screen.
